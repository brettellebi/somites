# Notes

## 25 March 2022

Testing different HMM parameters:

* `workflow/scripts/test_hmm.py`

## 21 March 2022

Added new phenotypes file including reporter:

Original: `data/phenos_with_reporter_genoandpheno.csv`, provided by Ali via Slack on 17 March 2022; previous pheno file including reporter pheno.

Process for converting from .csv to 
`book/Add_reporter_geno_to_pheno_file.Rmd`

New: `data/20220321_phenotypes.xlsx`

## 18 March 2022

Issue with aligning F1 samples:

```
[0000] 3. Calling kt_for - worker_sam
[mem_sam_pe_batch_post] paired reads have different names: "NB501764:1497:HGMH7AFX3:1:11105:22518:17061", "NB501764:1369A/"
```

Requested that Ali re-upload the F1 sequences.

Used Google Drive and Rclone successfully to upload files

## 15 March 2022

Run GWAS on split inverse-normalised microscope, with reporter genotype as a covariate:

* `book/Reporter_as_covariate.Rmd`

## 14 March 2022

Sent Ali zoomed plots for PSM:

* `book/plots/20220214/hits_exploration/all_sites/unsegmented_psm_area`

And annotations (from rule get_annotations):

* `data/20220214/annotations/all_sites/unsegmented_psm_area/Microscope/TRUE/5000.csv`

## 9 March 2022

Inverse-normalise both microscopes then combine and run GWAS.

Notebook: `book/Inverse_normalise_by_microscope.Rmd`

## 8 March 2022

EB: 
* Need to think about permutations. Doesn't capture all the structure in the data. 
* Draw bonferroni correction on number of bins
* Could do something very crude. Could do bonferroni with a bit extra, like 1e-7, then take the top points, and for every top point, we add it back as a covariate. The signal for the correlated points should disappear. Look for a package that can do this... COJO?
* Fine mapping in the context of F2 cross.
* Sensible thing is to rank all the SNPs by p-value, and exclude chr 3. Rank all blocks by p-value, accept the top block, then some threshold that is like 5 Mb, then exclude all the p-values within 5 Mb of our accepted list. 
* Keep a list of points we've accepted, go down the list, and if it's within 5 Mb on something above, then exclude it. 
* Look at genes under that GO (gene ontology) terms.

## 26 February 2022

Ali provided F0 and F1 phenotypes: `data/F0_F1_period.xlsx`

Testing GWAS with covariates. 

```r
# This doesn't work
Plots = matrix(1:n_geno,nc = 10)
# But this does?
Plots = matrix(1:1200,nc = 10)
```

Error message:
```r
Error in `levels<-`(`*tmp*`, value = as.character(levels)) : 
  factor level [445] is duplicated
```

## 23 February

* Run association test with just AU microscope: `book/Association_testing_with_AU.Rmd`

## 3 February

Ali uploaded the deep sequencing of the F1 Kaga/Cab generation: `/nfs/ftp/private/indigene_ftp/upload/Ali/F1_Kaga-Cab_DeepSeq/`

## 2 February

Ali's explanation of PSM:

>The PSM is the presomitic mesoderm and it is the undifferentiated tissue that gives rise to the somites. The size of the PSM varies in different species. Ive done some measurements on the size (area) of the PSM of the pure Kaga and Cab strains and found that the Kagas have a smaller PSM at the same somite stage than the Cab PSM. The interesting thing is that the Kaga somites are also smaller than Cab somites, meaning everything scales. So essentially the size of the PSM is interesting to us from a morphology perspective and from a scaling perspective.

## 29 January

### New phenotypes

Ali sent 2 excel files:

* One with a new phenotype (unsegmented PSM): `data/UnsegmentedPSM_F2s_MASTER.xlsx`
* One with updated period measurements: `data/First648_F2_DF_FINAL.xlsx/`

Consolidate into single file:

```r
in1 = here::here("data/UnsegmentedPSM_F2s_MASTER.xlsx")
in2 = here::here("data/First648_F2_DF_FINAL.xlsx")

# read
df1 = readxl::read_xlsx(in1)
df2 = readxl::read_xlsx(in2)

# bind
out = dplyr::full_join(df2, df1, by = c("fish", "strain" = "population"))

# reorder
out = out %>% 
    # put unsegmented column first
    dplyr::select("fish", "strain", "unsegmented_psm_area", everything()) %>% 
    # reorder rows based on sample number
    dplyr::mutate("SAMPLE" = fish %>% 
                      stringr::str_remove("KC") %>% 
                      as.integer(.)) %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(SAMPLE) %>% 
    dplyr::select(-SAMPLE)

# write
writexl::write_xlsx(out, here::here("data/20220214_phenotypes.xlsx"))
```

### Microscope size

>We discovered that there is about 3.5 minute difference in the mean when comparing F2 embryos imaged on the AU scope vs the DB scope (DB being higher, plot attached), based on other experiments we have done this translates to an effective temperature difference of 0.7 degrees celsius between the two scopes. And although i measured the temperature inside the microscope box with a regular thermometer and it was 30 degrees on the DB scope, the internal temperature sensor is placed in different places on the AU and DB scope and they are also from a different manufacturer, so that might explain the difference.

>Since all the F0s and F1s were imaged on the AU scope and since the majority of F2s were imaged on the AU scope and since we have extensively calibrated the temperature on the AU scope due to other projects in the lab we are more confident of the correctness of the temp measurements on the AU scope. 

>So i was wondering if we can do something like 'batch correction' on the F2s imaged on the DB scope. Essentially the easiest i thought of was just to subtract the 3.5 minutes difference from the DB scope measurements. But probably you and Tom are more experienced in this type of thing.


## 22 January 2022

Email from Ali:

-   F1 sequences are still being processed at Genecore
-   Have an additional 55 embryos from the F2 cross that were phenotyped and sent to sequencing – will be uploaded to the FTP shortly
-   Finishing up the second phenotype measures from the same F2 fish: morphology and size of presomitic mesoderm and forming somites. Initial plots show they look normally distributed between the F0s and there is no correlation with period(!)

## 2 December 2021

Ali has sent the third batch of F2 data.

Sample 323 is missing the first pair. 

## 26 November 2021

Suggestions from EB:

-   Set up guardrails -- e.g. the site must have at least 0.2 to 0.8 iCab vs Total
-   Limit to >= 100 and <= 10000
-   Plot chromosomes before filtering

    -   Appears specific to plants, as it infers parental sequence from the progency seqeunce bcause "the plants that were sequenced are usually not the same ones that were used to make the full sib population and may have somewhat different genotypes" (https://bitbucket.org/tasseladmin/tassel-5-source/wiki/UserManual/FSFHapImputation/FSFHapImputation). 
    -   "Also, the progeny taken together generally provide very high coverage for the parental sequence and are often a better source for inferring the parent sequence than the parents themselves. FSFHap has a few different algorithms for inferring the parent haplotype. The default is the most robust and should be tried first for populations derived from F1's."
    -   "The windowLD method works well for highly inbred parents, but has problems if one of the parents has residual heterozygosity. Additional options exist for backcross populations."

### `lftp`

Hi, You can use the lftp command present in datatransfer.embl.de (here
is a tutorial)
<https://linuxconfig.org/lftp-tutorial-on-linux-with-examples> . If you
want to send files that are in your group share, they will be available
at /g/ location. Cheers.

## 3 August 2021

Added Cab and Kaga karyoplots.

Removed use of (almost) all wrappers in Snakemake pipeline. Now all
rules are containerised other than for pulling the reference sequence
from Ensembl.

[NOTE]{color="red"}: Install `plotly` and `DT` in R container.

## 15 July 2021

Notes for Ali:

-   Tried sample 171 again (the one you uploaded again), and it failed
    again at the alignment stage with the following error:

```{bash, eval = F}
[mem_sam_pe_batch_post] paired reads have different names: "�0�����O&�����x�7�Z�HĻ�@�%Q�ü��", "ST-K00119:220:HKNVLBBXY:7:1101:1661:1138"
```

-   Fixed the sample names so that they don't include the pool number at
    the beginning, e.g. sample 171 is no longer called 7171

-   Cab has 15M homozygous sites, whereas Kaga only has 5M. Reason: Cab
    aligns better to HdrR, so there are many more 0/0 calls?

-   3.48M homozygous sites after joining Cab and Kaga homozygous site
    DFs.

-   2.7M homozygous divergent sites.

### Notes:

-   Genetics:

    -   Increase block size?

        -   Try site-by-site
        -   HMM would need to work on a *count* system so that it
            doesn't get skewed

-   [**ACTION**]{color="red"} (Ian):

    -   Check colours:

        -   Would expect Cab skew, especially as it has the reporter.

-   [**ACTION**]{color="red"} (Ian):

    -   Find number of reads covering each block for each individual.

    -   If they reach \< 5, increase the block size.

    -   Also check out chr 16 reporter locus.

    -   Make histogram of counts per block for each individual.

    -   Data frame:

        -   Fish ID
        -   Block ID
        -   Allele
        -   Count

    -   Plot a boxplot of counts per allele for all blocks per
        individual.

    -   Do for 5, 10 and 15 kb windows, then make boxplots to compare.

    -   Expect coverage across the homo-divergent regions is quite
        uneven.

    -   Also estimate heritability?

-   [**ACTION**]{color="red"} (Ali):

    -   Eyeball high phenotype points

    -   Also look at the plate position.

    -   Is there a between-day effect? (Note: Can only image 10
        individuals per day)

    -   Run a Kruskal-Wallis test for:

        -   day
        -   microscope (if they differ)
        -   any other way you can split it up
        -   look at the within-individual variance too

-   Re: sample size:

    -   Pause imaging while we check the above.
    -   Want to see the parents tight, and the F2 stretching out.
