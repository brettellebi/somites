## Load genotypes and positions

```{r}
in_list = readRDS(GENO_FILE)
```

## Read in phenotypes
```{r}


## Read in file and wrangle
phenos = readxl::read_xlsx(PHENO_FILE) %>%
    # adjust sample names
    dplyr::mutate(SAMPLE = fish %>% stringr::str_remove("KC")) %>%

    # THIS IS THE (big) CHANGE: filter for microscope
    dplyr::filter(Microscope == MICROSCOPE)

```

## Filter for samples with both genos and phenos

```{r}
## Filter and order phenotypes
in_list[["phenotypes"]] = phenos %>%
    # filter phenotypes for those with genotypes
    dplyr::filter(SAMPLE %in% in_list[["sample_order"]]) %>%

## Get number of samples
N_SAMPLES = in_list[["sample_order"]] %>%

## Run GWAS

```{r, eval = F}

## Run permutations

### Permute phenos

```{r, eval = F}

  # set seed
  set.seed(seeds[counter])

  # randomise
  phenos = orig_phenos

      dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(all_of(TARGET_PHENO),
                                  ~ sample(.x)))
})
```

### Run GWLS

```{r, eval = F}

```

```{r}

```

### Get minimum

```{r}

                         min(., na.rm = T)

# Get minimum
SIG_LEVEL = min(perm_df$MIN_P)

# Get bonferroni correction
SIG_BONF = ALPHA / ncol(in_list[["genotypes"]])

## Generate Manhattan plot

```{r}
