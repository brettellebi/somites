# F2 recombination blocks (filtered sites)

Exclusions:
-   reads overlapping *HdrR* repeat regions
-   regions of persistent heterozygosity in the MIKK panel
-   filtered based on read count and proportion of Cab)

Snakefile for running HMM and generating figures: https://github.com/brettellebi/somites/blob/master/workflow/rules/05_F2_recomb_blocks.smk
