# GWLS results

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(here)
source(here::here("book/source/04-Association_testing.R"))
```

## Notes

* 20211104 association test performed on full sites file. Results here: `/nfs/research/birney/users/ian/somites/association_testing/20211104_true/results`
* 20211109 association test performed on sites excluding those overlapping repeat regions. Results here: `/nfs/research/birney/users/ian/somites/association_testing/20211109_true/results`
* 20220214 association tests performed on all filter types and including PSM size as a third phenotype.

## Snakemake rules
